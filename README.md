# Hey folks ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer in the welding industry working on machine vision and robotics. 

In my free time I like programming games and stuff in C.

## Homepage :house_with_garden:
Just a collection of links for my games and stuff.
[horsimann.de](http://www.horsimann.de)

## Recipes :spaghetti:
I note my favorite recipes here on Github (written in german).
See my [Homepage](http://www.horsimann.de)

## My C game engine :wrench:
I created my own engine called [some](https://github.com/renehorstmann/some).

**some** is an acronym for *"Sdl2 Opengl Mini Engine"*

With **some** I have written some cool apps and games like:

## Pixel Art Editor :art:
[Pixelc](https://github.com/renehorstmann/Pixelc) is my free to use and open source pixel art editor.

**Pixelc** works fine on Desktop or Mobile, with the WebApp or as Android App.

Try the multitouch mode :wink:

I created **Pixelc**, because other mobile pixel art editors where lacking some features for me and it was a nice App to test out my engine.

## Math library in C :triangular_ruler:
[Mathc](https://github.com/renehorstmann/mathc) is my linalg library for vector and matrix math, used in 3D programming and games (**some** includes and uses it)

## C standard library addition :paperclip:
[rhc](https://github.com/renehorstmann/rhc) is a collection of some usefull C standard library stuff, like dynamic array (like C++ std::vector) or to handle sockets, etc. (**some** includes and uses it)

## 3D OpenGL PointCloud and Mesh Viewer :telescope:
> Not in active use. For those who may want to use it:

[Visu](https://github.com/renehorstmann/Visu) is a library to render 3D pointclouds and meshs in OpenGL with an ease.

## Master Thesis :page_with_curl:
If you want to have a look: [Master Thesis](https://github.com/renehorstmann/MasterThesisPrint).

Title is:

*Extension of Robot Programming by Collision Detection and Configuration Determination, by Simulation and Analysis of Kinematics*

### Have a nice day :wink:

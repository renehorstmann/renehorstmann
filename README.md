# Hey folks ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer in the agricultural machinery industry working on machine vision and robotics to automate manufacturing processes.

In my free time I like programming games and stuff in C.


## Homepage :house_with_garden:
Just a collection of links for my games and stuff.

## Recipes :spaghetti:
I note my favorite recipes here on Github (written in german).
See my [Homepage](https://www.horsimann.de)


## My C game engine :wrench:
I created my own engine called [Mia](https://github.com/renehorstmann/Mia).

Mia uses high level object oriented programming with a tree based resource management.

Already included are an Examples App; a [Tea Timer App](https://horsimann.de/tea); and a work in progress paint app.


## Climbr, Celeste-Like Mobile Jump And Run :joystick:
Not open source but nevertheless my first serious game.

Baed on my old C engine [some](https://github.com/renehorstmann/some).

[Play the Climbr WebApp-Demo](https://horsimann.de/climbr)

## Pixel Art Editor :art:
[Pixelc](https://github.com/renehorstmann/Pixelc) is my free to use and open source pixel art editor.

**Pixelc** works fine on Desktop or Mobile, with the WebApp or as Android App.

Try the multitouch mode :wink:

I created **Pixelc**, because other mobile pixel art editors where lacking some features for me and it was a nice App to test out my engine.

Baed on my old C engine [some](https://github.com/renehorstmann/some).

### Have a nice day :wink:
